Unfortunately, I can not host a live demo of this project as Spotify requires approval for apps to use their
API without having them listed as a user in the spotify API dashboard.

Fuseify allows a group of Spotify users to take their libraries and jam it all into one playlist!
First a user logs into spotify, provides the email of everyone else they want in their group. then Fuseify
sends an email to each other user for them all to log in. Finally once everyone is logged in it makes a playlist
with the top 100 most common songs between them all!
